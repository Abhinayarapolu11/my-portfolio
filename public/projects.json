      "description": "To reconstruct a 3D model of an object by projection of fringe patterns using Deep Learning methods. Fringe Projections are projected onto a 3D object and an image is taken from camera. This image is then used to find the depth map of the 3D object. An extensive testing and constant training of Deep Learning models such as UNet, PSMNet and HRNet were proved useful and calibration is done to get the final 3D Profiling.",

A project in collaboration with an Agritech company, Vegrow where a camera is used to take images of trees from a farm containing fruits and the sizes of fruits are estimated using Deep Learning techniques and statistics and calibration to get the final result in mm. Numerous field tests were conducted to make the most generic and robust model.",
